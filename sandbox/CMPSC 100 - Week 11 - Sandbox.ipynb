    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, this space is for *you*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use this notebook to try out code presented in class or do self-guided exploration. Your instructor may reference this notebook and ask that you write some code in it to follow along with in-class exercises or live programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also encourage you to use this as a space to take notes as you participate in discussions or practice coding concepts on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "The following key combinations and shortcuts will speed your work in this notebook.\n",

    "| Key(s) | Outcome |\n",
    "|:-|:-|\n",
    "| `Enter` | Adds a new line in the current cell |\n",
    "| `Shift` + `Enter` | Runs the current cell and moves to the first cell below |\n",
    "| `Ctrl` + `Enter` | Runs the current cell; cursor remains in cell |\n",
    "| `Alt` + `Enter` | Runs current cell and inserts new cell below ||\n",

    "\n",
    "The readings below are meant to serve as references for you as you explore practical use of our course's platforms. As always, however, feel free to reach out to your instructors or post questions in our course [Slack](cmpsc-100-00-fa-2020.slack.com).\n",

    "### Using Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "For questions about using a Jupyter Notebook, our colleagues at Bryn Mawr created a [Jupyter Notebook User's Manual](https://jupyter.brynmawr.edu/services/public/dblank/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb) which answers basic and advanced questions about the platform.\n",
